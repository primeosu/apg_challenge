VERSIONS:

- ubuntu:   16.04.01 LTS
- postgres: 9.4
- nodejs:   4.5.0

DIRECTIONS:

Feel free to skip over the node section if it's already installed

I. Install/Configure postgres

   1. remove existing postgres (optional)

      - command: sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql\*

   2. install postgres
   
      - command: sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4

   3. test connection to psql terminal to work with postgres

      - command: sudo -u postgres psql postgres
      - you use this command every time you want to use
        the command linke to work with postgres
      - usually you can type psql to get into the terminal
        but only after you set roles/admin rights
      - type \q to quit
      
   4. alter default user's ('postgres') password

      - in the psql terminal: ALTER USER Postgres WITH PASSWORD 'apg-challenge';
      - this makes the password for account, postgres, to apg-challenge

   5. augment database connection method

      - command: sudo [emacs|vi|editorOfYourCHoice] /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf
      - change this line: local   all             postgres                                peer
        to this line:     local   all             postgres                                md5
      - connection problems would occur right here if you didn't change peer to md5
      
   6. restart server
      
      - command: /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
      
II. Create Table in postgres database

   1. log into psql

      - command: sudo -u postgres psql postgres 

   2. create table

      - create table malware1 ("MD5" text unique, "ClassificationName" text, "ClassificationType" text, "Size" integer, "FileType" text);

   * Useful Commands:
   
   \list						 -> displays all databases
   \dt+	       		   	       		    	 -> list all tables in database
   \d+ [tableName]	   	       	    	    	 -> displays structure of table, "tableName"
   /etc/init.d/postgresql [status|start|stop|restart]    -> check status, start, stop, restart database

   * Note:

	- the connection string in the nodejs code is: postgres://postgres:apg-challenge@localhost:5432/postgres
   	- the code is told to connect to either the live database hosted by heroku or the local database

III. Install Node

   1. install

      - follow this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04

IV. Set Up Working Directory/start application server/use application

   1. copy from repo

      - command: git clone https://github.com/Pplum09/apg_challenge.git

   2. install dependencies

      - cd into working directory apg_challenge
      - command: npm install

   3. start server

      - command: npm start

   4. use application

      - in the browser of your choice (please use chrome), navigate to localhost:3000

CONCLUSION

Thanks so much for taking your time to check out this application and hopefully get it working. If for some reason these instructions
do not work, you can always view the live demo here: intel-apg-challenge.herokuapp.com

I want to say that to date, this is one of my favorite projects/type of projects to work on and I hope to really learn more in this
web application, full-stack making, headache inducing industry.

Thanks :D
