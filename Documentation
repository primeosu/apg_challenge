Method for running the Application:

1) In order to run this application you are going to have to connect to my database. The code to connect is already before the header in the PHP file on csv-upload.php. 

2) You will need to provide the IP address that you are using so that I can manually add that address to the allowed list on the DB. This will allow you to connect. 

3) if this fails you can view the application live http://jport1992.com/intelchallenge.php

4) These files are both saved at extension .php, so you will need a server to run these files.

5) Do not place these files in seperate folders, as there mapped out to be in the same directory.

6) You should be good to go from here, just make sure that you are uploading a CSV file with the exact columns and headers expected in the document details that were given.

7) You will not be able to see the DB structure so I will place the table structure below.

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `csv_import` (
      `ID` int(25) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      `MD5` varchar(250) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
      `ClassificationName` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
      `ClassificationType` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
      `Size` int(25) NOT NULL,
      `FileType` varchar(5) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL
    )
