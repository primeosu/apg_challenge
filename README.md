## Configuration

### MySQL Configuration
* To use this app you must provide a database and associated user with full read and write permissions.
* The MySQL database connection is configured by editing the ```mysql``` property in ```env.json```.
* The app will create a new table called ```files``` within the configured database. 

### Port Configuration
* By default the app is served from ```http://localhost:8000```
* The ```port``` can be configured in ```env.json```.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
This command should not be run as a superuser or administrator.  Doing so will prevent
the ```"postinstall"``` script (defined in ```package.json```) from running.

## Run App
```bash
npm start
```
After the app has launched navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
