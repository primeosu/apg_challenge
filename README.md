# Intel Security Programming Challenge
Please complete the following programming challenge.  It is used to better assess a candidate's software development skills.   You have as much time as you'd like (though we ask that you not spend more than a few hours) and may use any programming language or framework you'd like.  Feel free to contact the original sender if you have any questions.

## Submission Instructions
1. First, fork this project on github.  You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
1. Next, complete the project as described below within your fork.
1. Finally, push all of your changes to your fork on github and submit a pull request.

## Project Description
Imagine that Intel Security has just acquired a new security company.  Unfortunately, the company has never stored their data in a database and instead uses plain text files.  We need to create a way for the new subsidiary to import their malware data into a database.  Your task is to create a web interface that accepts file uploads, normalizes the data, and then stores it in a relational database - design is up to you.

Here's what your web-based application must do:

1. Your app must accept (via a form) a CSV file with the following columns: MD5, ClassificationName, ClassificationType, Size, FileType.  You can assume the columns will always be in that order, that there will always be data in each column, that there will always be a header line, and that the CSVs could potentially have duplicate MD5s.  An example input file named example_input.csv is included in this repo.
1. Your app must parse the given file, normalize the data, and store the information in a relational database.
1. After each upload, your application should display the total amount of each different ClassificationType in the database.  So for example: trojan -> 3, pup -> 2, unknown -> 1, etc.

Your application does not need to:

1. be written with any particular language or framework
1. be aesthetically pleasing (bonus points if it does, extra bonus points for using Bootstrap)

Your application should be easy to set up and should run on Linux.  It also should not require any for-pay software.  If you are unfamiliar with what an MD5 is, it may be helpful to read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria:

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
1. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?

## Setup
To setup this server, you must do the following.

* Setup an .env file at the root of this project. This is included, but should not normally be included in version control.
* Have the following installed on the machine:
 * PHP 5.5.9+
 * OpenSSL PHP Extension
  * http://php.net/manual/en/openssl.installation.php
 * PDO PHP Extension of database of choice
  * http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php
 * Mbstring PHP Extension
  * http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php
 * Tokenizer PHP Extension  
  * http://php.net/manual/en/tokenizer.installation.php
 * Composer
  * https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx

Once the above is setup, run 'composer update' and 'composer install.' This updates and installs the dependancies for Laravel.

After the above finishes, run 'php artisan serve' in this directory to start a server on localhost:8000

## Heroku
This app is currently hosted on Heroku available to anyone that doesn't want to set it up on their own machines.
It is available here: https://apg-challenge.herokuapp.com/
